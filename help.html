<div>
<p>KinderClassRoom provides a different way of viewing material from a Google Classroom. It is designed with younger students in mind. KinderClassRoom pulls together their daily activities into a straightforward interface. The daily schedule is prominently displayed and kids can check off each task as they finish. It's easy to see which tasks are complete and which remain!</p>

<p>To use KinderClassRoom,visit the website from the computer or device your child will be using. You'll need to log into their Google Classroom account and grant the requested permissions to the kinderclassroom.org website. Then, you can set up your child's custom schedule, and the information will be saved in their internet browser. Each time they visit kinderclassroom.org, their custom schedule and previously completed work for that week will be reloaded. However, if you clear the cache for the website or choose to remove "website data" or "local browser data," that information will be lost and you will need to redefine their custom schedule.</p>

<p>Once you have the schedule set up how you want, click the 'Save' button to save updates and return to the main website. Then the site is ready for your child to use. Let them know they can click on each subject in the yellow schedule on the left side to bring up their tasks. The tasks will appear in the blue table, and they can scroll down through that table to look at all the tasks. After they finish each task, they can click the 'to do' button on the left side of the task. Once all of the tasks for a given subject are finished, that subject will automatically be checked off in the schedule, making it easy for your child to see what they have finished and what is left to do!

<h4 style="text-align: middle;">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h4><br/>
<p>Please check out these questions and <a href="contact.html">let us know</a> if you have others not answered here:</p><br/><ul><!-- and <a href="contact.html">let us know</a> if you have others not answered here.-->
<li><b>Can anyone use KinderClassRoom?</b><br/>KinderClassRoom is meant to be used in conjunction with Google Classroom. Anyone participating in a class on Google Classroom is welcome to try accessing their class through our site. However, this site has been configured to work with the organizational style of specific teachers, so it may not be as useful for you if your Google Classroom is organized differently.</li><br/>
<li><b>Why can't I see the schedule updates I made on a different computer?</b><br/>Currently, KinderClassRoom does not save any of your data online, which would be necessary for you to see updates from other devices. All schedule changes you make are stored on that computer only.</li><br/>
<li><b>How do I view course content from weeks other than the current week?</b><br/>KinderClassRoom is designed to focus on the current week of work. To access content from further in the past or in the future, you'll need to look directly in the Google Classroom for your class.</li><br/>
<li><b>How can I contribute to this project?</b><br/>Ideas or code contributions are welcome. Feel free to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mbezaire/kindergarten">fork this site on GitHub!</a> <!--a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/MarianneBezaire">Donations</a> are awesome, too.--></li><br/>
<li><b>Can I make a spin off website that better fits the organization of my Google Classroom?</b><br/>Of course! The site is under an <a target="_blank" href="LICENSE">MIT License</a>.</li>
